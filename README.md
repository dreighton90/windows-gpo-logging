# Windows PowerShell & GPO Logging(Bootcamp)

## üß† Executive Summary

This project simulates securing a Windows Server environment by enabling advanced PowerShell logging and configuring Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The goal was to enhance system visibility, enforce account lockout policies, and validate changes using remote Windows virtual machines. These configurations are foundational for detecting malicious activity and supporting compliance in enterprise networks.

## ‚úÖ Realism and Business Relevance

- Mirrors real-world tasks performed by Blue Team analysts, system administrators, and compliance teams
- Emphasizes endpoint visibility through script block and module logging
- Supports audit-readiness by enforcing lockout thresholds and security baselines via GPO

---

## üöÄ Scalability Beyond Bootcamp

This lab can be expanded by:
- Forwarding logs to a centralized SIEM like Splunk or Wazuh
- Automating policy deployment using PowerShell scripts
- Creating alert rules based on logged suspicious activity

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- PowerShell logging configuration:
  - Module Logging
  - Script Block Logging
  - Transcription Logging
- Account lockout policy tuning
- Enumerating and reviewing Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Remote VM configuration and system hardening
